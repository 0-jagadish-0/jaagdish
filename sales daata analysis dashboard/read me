# Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project showcases the development of a complete sales analysis pipeline, from raw data cleaning and preprocessing to creating an interactive dashboard for insightful decision-making. The goal of this project is to identify key business metrics such as revenue, profit margins, market contributions, and customer-level insights.

## Project Workflow

### 1. **Automated Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
The raw sales data was cleaned and prepared for analysis using Python and the Pandas library. The data cleaning process was automated to ensure consistency and efficiency across different datasets. Key steps included:  
- **Data Loading**: Extracting raw data from a MySQL database.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data structure and identifying missing or erroneous entries.  
- **Automated Data Cleaning**:  
  - Imputing missing values.  
  - Basic data masking (e.g., anonymizing customer IDs).  
  - Automatically detecting and removing duplicate records.  
  - Standardizing inconsistent data formats.  
- **Data Transformation**:  
  - Renaming columns for clarity.  
  - Converting data types for consistency.  
  - Creating calculated fields, such as profit margins, discounts, and totals.  
- **Validation**: Ensuring the cleaned dataset met quality standards and was ready for visualization.  

### 2. **Data Visualization with Tableau**
An interactive dashboard was created using **Tableau** to present the cleaned data visually. Key features of the dashboard include:  
- **Revenue and Sales Metrics**: Displaying revenue, sales quantity, and profit margins.  
- **Market Analysis**: Profit margin and profit percentage contributions by market.  
- **Customer Insights**: Identifying top contributors to revenue and profit.  
- **Revenue Trends**: Visualizing monthly/quarterly/yearly revenue trends.  
- **Profit Margins**: Highlighting profit percentage contributions by various categories.  

### 3. **Data Extraction from MySQL**
Data was extracted from a MySQL database, ensuring seamless integration between the raw data source and the processing workflow.

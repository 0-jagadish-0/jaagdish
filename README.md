## 🌟 Featured Projects

Here are some highlights of my portfolio. Each project includes a detailed explanation, code, and visualizations.

### **1. Web Scraping Quotes**
- **Description:** This script scrapes quotes, their authors, and tags from the website 'https://quotes.toscrape.com'. 
    The data is saved into a CSV file named 'quotes.csv'.This is my first attempt at web scarping
- **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, Requests, Beautifulsoup)
- **Key Insights:** 
  - The script demonstrates how to scrape structured data from a website (https://quotes.toscrape.com).
  - Extracts quotes, their respective authors, and associated tags from multiple pages.
  - The collected data is stored in a CSV file (quotes.csv) for further analysis or usage.
- **Limitations and Areas for Improvement:**
  - Static Website: Works well for static websites like quotes.toscrape.com, but might need adjustments for dynamic or JavaScript-rendered pages.
  - Error and Timeout Handling: Lacks explicit handling for potential errors like network issues or server timeouts.
